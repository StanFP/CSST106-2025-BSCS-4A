# Project Outline

## 1. Selection of Dataset and Algorithm:
- Each student will choose a dataset suitable for object detection tasks. The dataset can be from publicly available sources (e.g., COCO, PASCAL VOC) or one they create.
- Select an object detection algorithm to apply to the chosen dataset. Possible algorithms include:
  - **HOG-SVM (Histogram of Oriented Gradients with Support Vector Machine)**: A traditional method for object detection.
  - **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: A real-time deep learning-based approach.
  - **SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector)**: A deep learning method balancing speed and accuracy.

## 2. Implementation:

### Data Preparation:
- Preprocess the dataset by resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and, if necessary, labeling bounding boxes for objects.

### Model Building:
- Implement the selected object detection algorithm using appropriate libraries (e.g., OpenCV for HOG-SVM, TensorFlow/Keras for YOLO or SSD).

### Training the Model:
- Use the training data to train the object detection model. For deep learning methods, fine-tune hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size, epochs) to optimize model performance.

### Testing:
- Evaluate the model on a test set to assess its detection capabilities.
- Ensure to capture edge cases where the model may struggle.
